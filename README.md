# MNIST-Neural-Network-From-Scratch

A Python implementation of a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, built from scratch using only basic Python and minimal NumPy. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of neural networks including feedforward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

## Features

- Pure Python implementation with minimal dependencies
- Full neural network implementation from scratch
- Clear, well-commented code explaining each step
- Achieves ~76% accuracy on the MNIST test set
- Includes visualization of input data
- Educational resource for understanding neural networks

## Architecture

The neural network has the following architecture:
- Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels)
- First hidden layer: 112 neurons
- Second hidden layer: 16 neurons
- Output layer: 10 neurons (one for each digit)

## Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for loading MNIST dataset)
